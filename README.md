# S3-Web_Server_Final_project : A REST API project with Node.js, Express and Handlebars

## *What is this project ?* 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, we created a REST API with NodeJS to serve data from a JSON database.

## *What is the database ?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The database to be used in this project is a JSON file that contains information about Nobel Prizes and Nobel Laureates.

## *Tasks to do :*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Create a new NodeJS project.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Create a REST API using the RCS or RCSM template.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ RCS: Routers - Controllers - Services  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ RCSM: Routers - Controllers - Services - Models  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Try to refer to work done in the first three weeks to structure your application.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Week 1: Read/Write to a file  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Week 2: Express + RCS  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Week 3: Express + RCSM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Create the API entry point, routers, controllers and services (ormodels). Be careful that you can have multiple routers. Think of the number of entities that this JSON document contains.
