# S3-Web_Server_Final_project : A REST API project with Node.js, Express and Handlebars

## *What is this project ?* 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, we created a REST API with NodeJS to serve data from a JSON database.

## *What is the database ?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The database to be used in this project is a JSON file that contains information about Nobel Prizes and Nobel Laureates.

## *Tasks to do :*
* ● Create a new NodeJS project.  
* ● Create a REST API using the RCS or RCSM template.  
* ○ RCS: Routers - Controllers - Services
* ○ RCSM: Routers - Controllers - Services - Models  
* ● Try to refer to work done in the first three weeks to structure your application.  
* ○ Week 1: Read/Write to a file  
* ○ Week 2: Express + RCS  
* ○ Week 3: Express + RCSM  
* ● Create the API entry point, routers, controllers and services (ormodels). Be careful that you can have multiple routers. Think of the number of entities that this JSON document contains.
